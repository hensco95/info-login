          I'm a software engineering student at
          <a href="https://altschoolafrica.com/" class="altz"
            >Altschool Africa</a
          >. At AltSchool, I get to learn the principles of software
          engineering, technical writing, open source contribution, and provide
          solutions to businesses that require my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently the co-lead of Circle 119, where I get to collaborate
          with fellow software engineers, as we gain much-needed exposure
          while building lifelong relationships as we learn. Asides learning in
          AltSchool, I'm also a Petroleum engineering student at the University
          of Port Harcourt, Rivers state.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm in AltSchool due to my desire to learn a skill that's in demand
          and due to the kindness of people, among whom is Frantz Kati, who
          helped me pay my school fees, and the Vesicash scholarship sponsors
          who gave me a full scholarship to study. Learning at AltSchool has
          provided me with a detailed learning path and the structure I needed
          when I first sought to learn software engineering. The 3 months
          guaranteed internship after the study program was also a major factor
          in my decision to enroll for AltSchool.

        <p>
          As a student in AltSchool, I look forward to learning best practices
          that would help me deepen my knowledge of software engineering. I'm
          also passionate about not being poor, so as I learn these skills being
          taught, I hope to provide value to businesses with my skills, which
          would in turn enrich me, helping me relieve my family of certain
          financial burdens. I look forward to giving back to the community
          through volunteering, mentorship and sponsorship.

      <p>
        I'd like to once again say a big THANK YOU to the Vesicash group for the
        scholarship and to the AltSchool team for their support. The
        journey has been worthwhile because of your contribution, thank you.
